# Optimize performance project 

- Lazy loading is the practice of delaying load or initialization of resources or objects until they're actually needed to improve performance 

- Caching (Redis, ImemoryCache, AWS elastic cache) 

- Load balance 

- Optimize resource  

- CDN 

# optimize database performance? 

- index , select specific column necessary 

- stored proceduce or function 

- limit use subquery 

- limit cast or convert data in stored procedure 

- remove index not used 

# What is your understanding of Entity Framework? 

Entity Framework Core is a modern object-database mapper for .NET. It supports LINQ queries, change tracking, updates, and schema migrations. EF Core works with many databases, including SQL Database (on-premises and Azure), SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Azure Cosmos DB. 

# How u secure the API service?    => JWT (Authentication, Authorization) 

# Thread : 

Mention about Synchronous and Asynchronous 

# how jwt works? authentication and authorization flow?    

JSON Web Token consists of 3 parts 

 => header    => authorize attribute, server generate token and check when client call        

# what is the information contain in jwt token?   

The header will contain the data type, and the algorithm used to encrypt the JWT . String 

payload will contain information about the user 

This signature will be generated by encrypting the header , the payload with a secret string. 

  - header    - payload: data, claims    - signature        

# what is claims in jwt?   

 In a JWT, a claim appears as a name/value pair where the name is always a string and the value can be any JSON value. Generally, when we talk about a claim in the context of a JWT, we are referring to the name (or key)    

# .net core lifetime scope?  

Transient Lifetime: Adding a transient service means that each time the service is requested, a new instance is created. A singleton is an instance that will last the entire lifetime of the application Scoped lifetime objects often get simplified down to “one instance per web request”      

# web api start without startup.cs file   

 In .NET 6 Microsoft has removed the Startup.cs class. Just go to the program.cs file   #dotnet core sql, migration file. The migrations feature in EF Core provides a way to incrementally update the database schema to keep it in sync with the application's data .  

    #code first? database first approach? in EF / Difference 

- DBFirst: Generated code are the same and you can combine this approaches. For example, you can create database using designer, than you can alter database using sql script and update your model. anual changes to the database are possible because the database defines your domain model. You can always update model from database (by sql script). 

- CodeFirst: you can creating simple standalone application without versioning and using model\database first in projects that requires modification in production. Full control over the code. Manual changes to database will be most probably lost because your code defines the database. 

# Lazy loading?  

Lazy loading is delaying the loading of related data, until you specifically request for it. It is the opposite of eager loading     

 # ConfigureServices vs  Configure   

 ConfigureServices is used to configure Dependency Injection   Configure is used to set up middlewares, routing rules, etc   

# stored procedure?     

# Authentication  vs Authorization   : 

Authentication is the process of ascertaining that somebody really is who they claim to be.   Authorization refers to rules that determine who is allowed to do what. E.g.   Adam may be authorized to create and delete databases, while Usama is only authorised to read.   

  - Identity service on .net? 

ASP.NET Core Identity is an authentication and authorization management library used for all types of projects from MVC, WebForms, WebAPI.   

# Dependency injection?     

 ASP.NET Core supports the dependency injection (DI) software design pattern,     which is a technique for achieving Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. Good for unit test, easier to extend applications or features. Reduces adhesion between ingredients 

# Routing?      

Routing is the process through which the application matches an     incoming URL path and executes the corresponding action methods   

   - compression algorithm? 

 - securing username/password between clients and server?   

  - Authenticating the user/ encrypt the data    

 - use OpenID    

 - Basic or Forms authentication (https)     

  -What secret key encryption?      

The secret key method of encryption, which involves the use of a single key, is used to encrypt and decrypt the information and is sometimes referred to as symmetric key cryptography
