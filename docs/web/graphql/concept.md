## GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs created by Facebook. GraphQL gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more.
- Get many resources in a single request
- Ask for what you need, get exactly that
- Evolve your API without versions (Add new fields and types to your GraphQL API without impacting existing queries)

## GraphQL consist of:
- Types
- Queries
- Mutators
- Resolvers

# Disadvantages:
- not good for upload file
- Complex setup
- It is very difficult to detect errors (spelling, error code, ...)
