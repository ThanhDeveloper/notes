## GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs created by Facebook. GraphQL gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more.
- Get many resources in a single request
- Ask for what you need, get exactly that
- Evolve your API without versions (Add new fields and types to your GraphQL API without impacting existing queries)
